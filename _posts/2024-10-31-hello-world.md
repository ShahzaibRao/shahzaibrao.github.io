# A Complete Journey through Docker's Core Concepts | Docker 360
Introduction And Architecture
Docker is an open container management platform. It is a software platform used to run applications contained within containers. Docker helps you separate your applications from your infrastructure, allowing you to deliver software quickly.

With Docker, you can manage your infrastructure in the same way you manage your applications. By leveraging Docker's technology, we can build, test, and deploy code quickly, significantly reducing the waiting time between writing code and running it in production.
